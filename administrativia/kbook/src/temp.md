### NGPaaS MSP requirements

The clear objectives of providing interactive, personalized, integrated, consistent, efficient, collaborative, and supportive services to user with specific goals.

- in business:
     - Increased agility and self-service
     - Improve customer loyalty and retention

- in technology:
    - Foundation platform for integrations 
    - Portal platform for future integrations and onboarding 

- in operation:
	- Reduce customer servicing costs
	- Streamlined process
	- Reduced time to market

to achieve
- Usability: easy information access and personalization 

- Functional fit by modularity: out-of-box functionality, easy-to-use 

- Reusability: Services based architecture Reuse existing technology Optimized

- Extensibility: platform for future imtegrations and scalable for future expansion

- Quality: optimized processes and compatibility


The translation of program-level goals and objectives into portal-specific principles. For instance, a program objective of “continuous process improvement” translates into “process automation and reduced human intervention” as primary principle. 
This primary principle translates into one or more derived principles such as “workflow automation and KPI monitoring and analysis,” and “continuous improvement initiatives.” The derived principles can then be mapped to portal product components and features that become the solution components.


### Multi-sided Platform (MSP)

MSP uses portal and platform functionality as an engine in:

- Business rules: Modeling of complex business processes requires configurable rules engine that can be used for handling complex business logic

- Workflow process: Portal provides workflow support for modeling business processes and implement and deploy workflows through the platform

- Business valuation: business modeling and exchanges are valuated through cryptocurrency

Many of the business goals such as providing
- business models built for ecosystem scope
- consolidated and holistic view of resources
- global view on available services
- productivity enhancements through collaboration and available intermediation  
- opportunity to optimize various cost of resources, services, intermediary, and ownership
- consistent user experience

are put in place through appropriate portal technologies for the MSP.


### Platform 

The execution platform, as NGPaaS core technology, for catalogues of available PaaS components and services, various workflow deployment, including numerous testing and validation as well as automated orchestration of PaaS components and services, service monitoring etc. The layered architecture includes:
- Business layer
- Operation layer
- Dev-for-Ops layer
- PaaS layer
- IaaS layer



The NGPaaS value realization is used to assess the success and effectiveness of related core technologies for the proposed business scenario. As a simple example, consider the business value list 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Business Value</th>
    <th>Process Layer</th>
    <th>NGPaaS Enabler</th>
    <th>Metrics</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reduction in operating cost and effort for support channels</td>
    <td>Enable multi-channel communication support</td>
    <td>NGPaaS-driven collaboration enablement</td>
    <td>Reduction in service call volumes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Improved customer experience </td>
    <td>Improve SLA adherence for high and medium incidents</td>
    <td>Leverage in-built integration portlets such as clipping portlet</td>
    <td>Reduction in cost for handling service calls</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Improvement in customer satisfaction index</td>
    <td>Enhancing productivity with streamlined processes</td>
    <td>Automate software process</td>
    <td>Reduction in manuale effort for software process</td>

One of the main challenges in portal programs is that project sponsors and business community are not able to quantify the benefits realized from portal investment.



### Portal value realization

 provides a quantifiable 


- Step-1: Identification of business value. Business requirements are gathered and prioritized based on its value. During this step we will also identify the organizational and technical capabilities that need to be transformed. This is referred to as “business value levers” in the Figure 2.6.

- Step-2: Mapping business values to next-level elements — We will then identify levers that are related to the business value levers. For instance, in Figure 2.5, operational and process levers need to be transformed to achieve the business value levers. Each of the business value levers is mapped to its corresponding operational and process lever elaborating how the business value is realized. This top-down approach provides a 360° view of transformation.

- Step-3: Map-next-level levers to portal capabilities and enablers—As a next step, we map the next-level levers derived in step 2 to specific portal capabilities, elements, and enablers. Here, we will identify portlets and portal components that will be used to implement the transformation.

- Step-4: Tracking metrics—Each of the portal components are mapped to metrics that quantify the improvements.
